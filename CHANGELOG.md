## [0.7.0-alpha] 2015-08-14

### Added

- New command: 'list' (alias: 'ls'). Allows you to list the source code of either your current location, or a location that you describe via: file:line, line number (in current file), +/- offset or /regexp/. (@joeshaw)
- Added Travis-CI for continuous integration. Works for now, will eventually change.
- Ability to connect to headless server. When running Delve in headless mode (used previously only for editor integration), you now have the opportunity to connect to it from the command line with `dlv connect [addr]`. This will allow you to (insecurely) remotely debug an application. (@tylerb)

### Changed

- Deprecate 'run' subcommand in favor of 'debug'. The 'run' subcommand now simply prints a warning, instructing the user to use the 'debug' command instead.

- Support for upcoming Go 1.5.
- Improve handling of soft signals on Darwin.
