## dlv debug

Compile and begin debugging main package in current directory, or the package specified

### Synopsis


Compiles your program with optimizations disabled, starts and attaches to it.

By default, with no arguments, Delve will compile the 'main' package in the
current directory, and begin to debug it. Alternatively you can specify a
package name and Delve will compile that package instead, and begin a new debug
session.

```
dlv debug [package]
```

You might have to hit `c` to start the process.

### Options inherited from parent commands
