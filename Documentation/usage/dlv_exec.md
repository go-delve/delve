## dlv exec

Execute a precompiled binary, and begin a debug session.

### Synopsis


Execute a precompiled binary and begin a debug session.

This command will cause Delve to exec the binary and immediately attach to it to
begin a new debug session. Please note that if the binary was not compiled with
optimizations disabled, it may be difficult to properly debug it. Please
consider compiling debugging binaries with -gcflags="-N -l".

```
dlv exec [./path/to/binary]
```
